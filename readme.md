This is a place for me to put my various QMK firmware profiles and compiled .hex files.

The easiest way to flash firmware (that has already been compiled) is with the [QMK Toolbox](github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox).

Install the Toolbox application, then open the .hex file. Check the "Auto-Flash" option, plug your controller in, and then when you bridge the GND and RST pins it should put the controller in bootloader mode and flash automatically.
