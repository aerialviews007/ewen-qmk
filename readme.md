This is a place for me to put my various QMK firmware profiles and compiled .hex files, plus a few .uf2 files for using RP2040-based boards. (It's weird that people hardly ever make the compiled firmware files available for download, right?)

The easiest way to flash firmware (that has already been compiled) is with the [QMK Toolbox](github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox).

Install the Toolbox application, then open the .hex file. Check the "Auto-Flash" option, plug your controller in, and then when you bridge the GND and RST pins it should put the controller in bootloader mode and flash automatically. If your keyboard has a reset switch you can press that instead, while for an Elite-C you should press its built-in reset switch.

For those RP2040-based boards, you just put the board into bootloader mode and drop the file into the drive that appears.
